/** 
 * <h3>
 * qooxdoo - a comprehensive and innovative Ajax framework
 * </h3>
 *
 * This is the qooxdoo framework top-level. It is the root of the qooxdoo class
 * hierarchy, and also contains some essential classes.
 *
 * Below you find a list of the contained classes, as well as an overview of all
 * the sub-packages with short descriptions. The classes on this level are
 * usually only used internally, and are not something you would want to
 * instantiate directly. Even using them as super-classes is considered advanced
 * usage. So in most cases application-level classes are in one of the
 * sub-packages.
 *
 * All sub-packages are structured in the same way. Use either the hyperlinks in
 * the listing, or the tree navigation structure to navigate to the
 * corresponding packages and their documentation. You can also use the "Search"
 * button to search for class and method names, and the "Legend" button to find
 * information about the symbols used throughout this reference. The "View" menu
 * allows you to tailer the amount of information that is displayed with each
 * class, e.g. you can enable display of inherited or protected class members.
