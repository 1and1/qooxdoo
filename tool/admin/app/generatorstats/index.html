<h1>Generator Build Stats</h1>
<p>
<i>$Id$</i>
<p>
Build times (in minutes) from the nightly builds of our standard apps, as
recorded on one of the build servers (currently <a href="http://172.17.12.142/~dwagner/workspace/qooxdoo-schlund/project/testing/logs/">172.17.12.142</a>). For each app, building includes source and build version, and is done with a fresh cash.
