ASTlets - AST Fragments
***********************

<note warning>
Work in Progress
</note>

This is an ongoing page to record and document the AST (abstract syntax tree) fragments (*"ASTlets"*), as they are generated by the tool chain Javascript parser. It shows how certain JS syntax constructs get translated into the corresponding AST representation. 
This serves mainly internal purposes and should not be relevant for a qooxdoo application developer.

The notation is a simplified tree structure that names token symbols and their nesting through indentation. "|" denotes alternatives.
