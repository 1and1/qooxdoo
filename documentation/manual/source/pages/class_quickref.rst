Class Declaration Quick Ref
***************************

This is a quick reference for the various features of a qooxdoo class declaration. It uses an EBNF-like syntax.

Properties, a particular part of the class declaration, have quite an extensive sub-spec, and are therefore factored out to their <properties_quickref|own page>.
