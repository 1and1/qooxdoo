The GroupBox offers the possibility to visual group several form elements together. With the use of a legend which supports both text and icon it is easy label the several group boxes to give the user a short description of the form elements.

Additionally it is possible to use checkboxes or radio-buttons within the legend to enable or disable the connected groupBox (and their child elements) completely. This feature is most important for complex forms with multiple choices.
