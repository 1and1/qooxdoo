A ComboBox is like a :doc:`.:TextField`  with a drop down of predefined values. The main difference to the :doc:`.:SelectBox` is that the user can enter individual values or choose from the predefined ones. The items in the predefined list supports plane text and/or icons. The items which can be added to the list are ``qx.ui.form.ListItem`` items. 

Please note that the ComboBox supports no auto-	completion.
