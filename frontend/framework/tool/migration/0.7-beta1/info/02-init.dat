extend\s*:\s*qx\.component\.AbstractApplication=Please derive your main application class from qx.application.Gui and make sure to call the super class in overwritten "main", "close" and "terminate" methods.
\bqx\.component\b=The "qx.component" and "qx.component.init" namespaces have been merged into the namespace "qx.application".

\bclose\s*:\s*function\(=Please make sure to call the overwitten method using "this.base(arguments)".
\bfinalize\s*:\s*function\(=The "finalize" method will no longer be called by the qooxdoo init system. Please call is from "main" directly or use a timer to call it deferred.
\binitialize\s*:\s*function\(="initialize" will no longer be called by the qooxdoo init system. Please call it from the constructor or the "main" method of the application.
