The QxStatusBar and QxStatusBarPane classes are intended as a status bar containing all kinds of widgets including messages for the user. Widgets like keyboard detection, clocks and debug messages can be added through the QxStatusBarPane class.

Files
=====
QxStatusBar.js		The status bar class.
QxStatusBarPane.js	The status bar pane class which is added to the status bar class fot each added widget.
Definitions.js		The class definitions not yet implemented in the Qooxdoo framework.
StatusBar_1.html	The example class.

Class Relationship
==================
QxWindow is a class which today has a hard coded static status bar class, but the QxStatusBar class is truly dynamic and could very well be used as such in QxWindow. Today it is a major component of QxFrame.

QxFrame has a property called statusBar and when it is set to a customized QxStatusBar widget, it will be shown a status bar at the bottom area of the frame.

Usage
=====
The class can be used in any application by adding the following two lines in your code. The Definitions.js file includes the setup of static as well as dynamic variable data for the class to be created, which has not yet been included in the Qooxdoo framework.

<script type="text/javascript" src="qooxdoo/source/contributed/statusbar_olsson/Definitions.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="qooxdoo/source/contributed/statusbar_olsson/QxStatusBar.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="qooxdoo/source/contributed/statusbar_olsson/QxStatusBarPane.js"></script>

You have to change the path in relation to your own code.

The Demo Class
==============
Shows creation of a simple QxFrame class, with a QxStatusBar at the bottom. The status bar has three widgets; a message, a keyborad and a clock widget.

Problems
========
THe layout design does not allow relative positions, which means that it is not possible to position of a fixed width QxStatusBarPane relative to the border the QxStatusBar. Instead spaces will be inserted between the border and teh QxStatuBarPane. This must be fixed in the layout design.
