The QxDialog class is intended for use as a custom created dialog, which can be in a modal state. In opposition to QxWindow, which is a decorated window class, the class is intended for major user interaction by for example answering on questions.

Class Relationship
==================
QxButtonPane is a class which is intended to be used as a standard row of buttons, which is possible to define in many different ways. It is very often used with the QxDialog class.

QxOptionPane is a specialized user interaction class, which can be used inside a QxDialog class, to create standard dialogs.

Usage
=====
The class can be used in any application by adding the following two lines in your code. The Definitions.js file includes the setup of static as well as dynamic variable data for the class to be created, which has not yet been included in the Qooxdoo framework.

<script type="text/javascript" src="qooxdoo/source/contributed/dialog_olsson/Definitions.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="qooxdoo/source/contributed/dialog_olsson/QxDialog.js"></script>

You have to change the path in relation to your own code.
