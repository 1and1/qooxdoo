The QxLocale class is intended for use to make localization possible for an application. The language, country and a variant can be et for multiple items at the same time with a default locale if necessary.

Files
=====
QxLocale.js		The locale class.
QxLocaleManager.js	The manager class of the locale.
QxResource.js		The resource class.
Definitions.js		The class definitions not yet implemented in the Qooxdoo framework.
Locale_1.html		The example class.


Class Relationship
==================
The QxLocaleManager manages the current QxLocale for an application. The QxResource gets the localised data from files by the transport mechanism implemented.

Usage
=====
The class can be used in any application by adding the following two lines in your code. The Definitions.js file includes the setup of static as well as dynamic variable data for the class to be created, which has not yet been included in the Qooxdoo framework.

<script type="text/javascript" src="qooxdoo/source/contributed/locale_olsson/Definitions.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="qooxdoo/source/contributed/locale_olsson/QxLocale.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript" src="qooxdoo/source/contributed/locale_olsson/QxResource.js"></script>

You have to change the path in relation to your own code.
