/**
 * DOM Event Layer
 *
 * The classes in this namespace provide a cross browser DOM event layer. It
 * normalizes not only the registration API but also normalizes behavior.
 * The event layer is able to support features, which are normally only
 * available in one browser, in all supported browsers. For a list of
 * supported features take a look at the class documentation of
 * {@link qx.event.Registration}.
 *
 * The central class is {@link qx.event.Registration}, which provides the event
 * registration and de-registration functionality.
