In my project I needed to iterate through the children tree starting by a given parent. So here is the class which I wrote for this.
Maybe it is usefull for someone else.

Usage is:

   var qxIter = new QxChildrenIterator(parent);
   var qxChild;

   while((qxChild = qxIter.getNext()) != null)  {
        // do something usefull with the child
   }
The loop is traversing bottom up a widget tree traversing first in depth and then on the same level.
